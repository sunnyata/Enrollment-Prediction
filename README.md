# International Student Enrollment a Public US University: First Source Analysis and Future Enrollment Predictive Models

## Abstract
Using data analysis, research and predictive classification models, this project aims to examine lead sources, identify influential factors for student enrollment among applicants, and determine the importance of third-party name purchases for higher education. 
For non-selective institutions with ambitious growth goals, acquiring cold leads or third-party inquiries is vital, as organic engagement is generally not sufficient to meet enrollment goals. Given the rise of domestic and international student data privacy laws, there is a risk that ASU may no longer be able to purchase the names of students from third-party suppliers and partners. 
With the above challenges in mind, this project also aims to build and compare the performance of various classification models that can be utilized to make predictions about applicants for more robust projections of future enrollment.
